            Hello everyone, my name is Mame. After years in the U.S. military, 
            I have dedicated the past several years to advancing my education and skills in technology 
            and skilled trades, with a particular focus on HVAC systems and building maintenance. 
            My early experience in the manufacturing industry as an automation technician gave me 
            a strong foundation in industrial control systems and process optimization.

        <div class="homepara2">
            Through my studies at Fayetteville Technical Community College, 
            I developed a solid understanding of air conditioning, heating, and refrigeration systems, 
            as well as preventive maintenance and energy efficiency practices. 
            I enjoy combining my technical background with hands-on HVAC work, 
            focusing on systems that improve comfort, performance, and sustainability in residential and commercial environments.

        <div class="homepara2">
            Today, I focus on expanding my technical expertise across multiple disciplines, 
            particularly in building systems, HVAC technology, and smart maintenance solutions. 
            My passion lies in integrating technology with skilled trades to create efficient, 
            sustainable, and comfortable living environments. 
            I take pride in delivering quality workmanship and ensuring every system operates at its best.
